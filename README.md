# Welcome to my website repo

This repo will house my personal/professional website. On this website, I will provide some information about myself, a portfolio page showcasing some of my projects, and a way to contact me.

## Work list

These are the things I am working on to improve my website. I will add to this list as time goes on. If you have any ideas of things to improve, please feel free to share; I am very interested in learning new things and improving.
- [x] collapsible NavBar on all pages
- [ ] responsive layout and images *done on home page, will apply to portfolio & contact pages*
