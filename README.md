# Welcome to my website repo

This repo will house my personal/professional website. On this website, I will provide some information about myself, a portfolio page showcasing some of my projects, and a way to contact me.

## Work list

These are the things I am working on to improve my website. I will add to this list as time goes on. If you have any ideas of things to improve, please feel free to share; I am very interested in learning new things and improving.
- [ ] collapsible NavBar on all pages - Having trouble getting the button that collapses and exapnds to respond to clicks
- [ ] responsive layout and images - On an xs screen, the content should take up the entire screen. On sm and larger screens, there should be some margines to the left and right sides of the screen. On md and larger screen, the content will take up the first 75% of the screen.
- [ ] utilize bootstrap classes to minimize the use of media queries
- [ ] use bootstrap's grid system
- [ ] use semantic html
- [ ] each page must have vlid and correct html
- [ ] must contain my personalized information (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc)

Bonus:

- [ ] using bootstrap, make a sticky footer
- [ ] use sub-rows and sub-columns on portfolio site
